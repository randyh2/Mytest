My name is Randolph Huynh. I am a senior studying Computer Science at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This is my submission for the Influential coding challenge.

For challenge 1, I created a file called "main.hs". Once the file is compiled it will take in this type of comamnd "./main 2 5 7

**Challenge 2**
There should be two files called "main.pl" and "main.rs". The test filed being used for both programs is "text.txt".
